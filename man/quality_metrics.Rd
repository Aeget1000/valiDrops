\item{counts}{A matrix containing counts for barcodes passing the barcode-rank threshold. See \link{rank_barcodes}}

\item{contrast}{An optional matrix containing contrasting counts for barcodes passing the barcode-rank threshold [default = NULL]. See details for more information.}

\item{contrast_type}{A string ("denominator" or "numerator") indicating the type of contrast to calculate [default = "denominator"]. See details for more information.}

\item{mito}{A vector of the identifiers for mitochondrial genes or "auto". If set to "auto", valiDrops will automatically find the identifiers of mitochondrial genes [default = "auto"].}

\item{ribo}{A vector of the identifiers for ribosomal genes or "auto". If set to "auto", valiDrops will automatically find the identifiers of ribosomal genes [default = "auto"].}

\strong{Using a contrast matrix}\cr
The fraction of reads derived from exons is a useful quality metric for both single-cell RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq. To calculate this metric, it is necessary to provide an additional matrix (the contrast matrix) and specify the constrast type. The exact specification of these two parameters depends on the which reads are included in the main count matrix. This often depends on the type of experiment. As a guideline, for:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Single-cell RNA-seq:} The main count matrix often contain only exon-derived reads. The contrast matrix should contains all reads (exons + intron) and the contrast_type should be "numerator".
  \item \strong{Single-nucleus RNA-seq:} The main count matrix often contains all reads (exons + intron). The contrast matrix should only contains exon-derived reads and the contrast_type should be "denominator".
}
